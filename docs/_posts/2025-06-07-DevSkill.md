## The Problem: Cracking the Code of Interview Success

Aspiring software engineers today face a maze of obstacles when preparing for technical interviews:

- **Fragmented Learning**  
  Resources are scattered across platforms, with no unified path that guides learners from foundational understanding to interview readiness.

- **Rote Memorization over Real Understanding**  
  Many platforms promote memorization of patterns rather than cultivating deep comprehension and adaptability.

- **No Real Feedback Loop**  
  Solving problems in isolation without knowing *why* a solution works—or how to improve—slows progress.

- **Inauthentic Interview Environments**  
  Most coding sites don’t simulate the pressure, context, and communication demands of actual interviews.

## The Solution: DevSkill

### 1. Structured Interview Simulator (Phase 1)

- **Company-Specific Problems**  
  Practice recently asked questions from top tech companies.

- **Three-Step Thinking Workflow**  
  Understand the problem, devise a strategy, and implement the code.

- **Live Feedback Engine**  
  Get rule-based (and soon AI-based) insights on logic, clarity, and code quality.

- **Real Interview Simulation**  
  Time limits, verbal reasoning support, and realistic interview flows.

---

### 2. The Foundation of Expertise (Phase 2)

- **Story-Based Curriculum**  
  Learn core programming and CS concepts through real-world metaphors.

- **Stages of Skill Growth**  
  Progress through five narrative-rich stages, from logic-building to advanced systems.

- **Conceptual First, Syntax Later**  
  Start with mental models, simulations, and pseudocode before touching real code.

- **Mastery-Based Progression**  
  Advance only when you’ve *truly* understood and can apply the concept.

---

### 3. Feedback and Progress Tracking

- **Skill Ratings**  
  Continuous assessment across Code Quality, Problem Solving, Technical Communication, and Language Proficiency.

- **Submission History**  
  Review past attempts, understand mistake patterns, and track improvements.

- **Adaptive Learning**  
  Future AI integrations will personalize challenges to your strengths and weaknesses.
